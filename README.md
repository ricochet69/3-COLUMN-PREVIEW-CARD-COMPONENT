## Overview

The challenge is to build a responsive 3-column preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible by using any tools I'd like to help me complete the challenge.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

Initally I thought CSS Grid would be a good choice to complete this challenge however, I wanted to practice using Flexbox more to build on my understanding of when and where to use it. I adopted a mobile first approach and created a main container to house my cards meaning I could centre it on screen by applying Flex to the body element. From there I built the styling for a single card, then targeting specific cards using "nth-child" selectors for anything more specific. All buttons have hover and focus states.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

My understanding of Flexbox became a lot more defined by completing this challenge.


### Continued development

I will continue my use of Flexbox to fully graps the concept and use cases of the tool.
